Svante Arrhenius predicted that fossil fuel consumption would eventually release enough carbon to warm the Earth by 5°C. Fast forward to now as the climate is continuously getting worse. This type of climate change, as we have learned in class, is inadvertently increasing the frequency and intensity of climate events around the globe. In 2022, floods caused by heavy monsoon rain devastated Malaysia. Recently, wildfires ravaged through Hawaii turning historic attractions to ash. Now, Hurricanes Milton and Helene have both just passed, each estimated to have claimed hundreds of lives while causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Now it’s more imperative than ever to have access to accurate and localized hurricane risk prediction. Overall, my work aims to create a machine learning-based system to predict the occurrence of a hurricane. Additionally, I would like to use the machine learning system to predict the intensity of the hurricane. I plan on analyzing hurricane features such as humidity, sea surface temperature, and wind shear to predict the likelihood of a hurricane occurring while using historical data to measure the intensity level of the hurricane. This allows us to take the necessary precautions in advance to try and minimize damages.
